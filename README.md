Welcome to my Work day scheduling application. This application allows the user to input important events throughout their day, save those events into local storage, and come back to view their schedule. The times of the day are also tracked and displayed as white if the time has passed, red for the current hour, and green for upcoming times. By entering your desires info into each hour slot and hitting save the information will be saved in the local storage and will be accesible to you in the future. At the top of the page you can see the current date to help with organization .
